## About Me

I am Muxing Li, a Ph.D. candidate at Trustworthy Machine Learning and Reasoning Group (TMLR) in the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, the University of Melbourne, advised by Dr. Feng Liu and Dr. Zesheng Ye. Before that, I was a research assistant in Centre for Frontier AI Research (CFAR) of Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR).  I am passionate about advancing the field of trustworthy machine learning.
